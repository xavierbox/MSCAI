    "Eight queens occupy a chess board. There is one queen per column and only one.\n",

    "An example is shown in the figure below.\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"./EightQueens.PNG\" style=\"width: 300px\" />\n",
    "     <figcaption>\n",
    "               Figure 1. Eight queens, one per column. The task is to distribute them\n",
    "               in rows so they dont attack each other. Queens attackt each other if they share a row\n",
    "               or a diagonal. One queen is missing in column 6.\n",
    "               If places in the 2nd row, it wouldnt be attacked. Two queens are\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure, two queens are highlighted. One is in colum 3 and row 1\n",
    "and the other is in column 4 and row 6. Note that if the missing queen\n",
    "is placed in the second row of column 6, it wouldnt attack any other\n",
    "queen. Yet,  this is not an acceptable solution because two queens\n",
    "attacke each other along a diagonal as shown in the figure. Two queens\n",
    "would attack each other if they are in the same row or the same diagonal.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "## The state\n",
    "All the queens are differentiable.We have queen 0,1,2...etc. These are\n",
    "the pieces in columns 0,1,2,3..etc.  The state is defined as the row\n",
    "of each queen. Namely, it is a set of eight integers, one per queen. Each\n",
    "integer value is constrained in the range [0,7]. This can be represented\n",
    "as a 8-component vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s = { x_1,x_2....,x_{n-1},x_n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example shown in Figure 1. the state would be:\n",

    "## Transitions \n",
    "For a given state $s_t$, the queen 0 has 8 choices. It can stay put, or it can move effectively\n",
    "    to seven different squares. For the second queen, the options are the same regardless of the location\n",
    "    of any other queen. Hence we have a total of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N =  8^8 -8 = 16 777 208 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "states that are reachable from any other state. We substract 8 in the formula above to acocut for the fact that if\n",
    "ALL the queens stay put, there is not a transition of states.  This is a large number of states, if we scan them by randomly moving queens until a solution is found, it may take a long time. There may be a better strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Hill-climbing algorithm  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Hill-climbing algorith aims at scaning the state-space in a way slightly better than just at random. \n",
    "    Basically, a state is chosen at ramdon form all available. If the the state is closer to a solution than before, \n",
    "    the transiotion is accepted and rejected otherwise. The algorithm may get stuck in configurations for which \n",
    "    after several trials is not found a acceptable transition. In either case, the closeness to a solution is determined according to a <it>cost function</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Cost function  \n",
    " An acceptable transition is one that takes the configuration from a state to another stage with the condition \n",
    "    that the final state is closer to a solution. The closeness is evaluated via a cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the advise of <cite>Russel & Norvig</cite>, the cost function will be taken as the \n",
    "    total count of pairs of queens attacking each other. In figure 1, the cost of the state would be 1. \n",
    "    The aim is to find a state with an associated cost of zero. \n",

    "\n",
    "   ### Queens in the same row   \n",
    "\n",
    "If two queens are in a row, there is one pair of them atacking each other. If three queens are in \n",
    "    a row, thenthere are 2 pairs. In general, the number is the number of ways we can pick 2 out of N \n",
