    <h1>The 8-queens problem</h1>

    <p>
        This is taken from chapter 3 in the book of <cite>Russel & Norvig</cite>
        It is not a complicated problem but I decided to look at it
        for several reasons. One is that it is mentioned in the book several times. 
        Another reason, because it seriously indicates the importance of defining and  
        computing a reasonable cost function. Finally, because
        ONE character in the code, makes a HUGE difference.  
        ONE chracter, that ultimately has to do with <i>Lateral displacements</i> in the
        context of hill-climbing algorithms. I found that very surprising and thats the main 
        reason I decided to document this example. 
    <p>

        <h2>The problem</h2>
        Eight queens occupy a chess board. There is one queen per column and only one.
        The task is to distribute the queens in different rows, so they o not attack each other.
        An example is shown in the figure below.
        <figure>
            <img src="EightQueens.PNG" style="width: 300px" />
            <figcaption>
                Figure 1. Eight queens, one per column. The task is to distribute them
                in rows so they dont attack each other. Queens attackt each other if they share a row
                or a diagonal. One queen is missing in column 6.
                If places in the 2nd row, it wouldnt be attacked. Two queens are
                attacking each other along the diagonal line shown
            </figcaption>
        </figure>


        In the figure, two queens are highlighted. One is in colum 3 and row 1
        and the other is in column 4 and row 6. Note that if the missing queen
        is placed in the second row of column 6, it wouldnt attack any other
        queen. Yet,  this is not an acceptable solution because two queens
        attacke each other along a diagonal as shown in the figure. Two queens
        would attack each other if they are in the same row or the same diagonal.


        <h2>The state</h2>
        All the queens are differentiable.We have queen 0,1,2...etc. These are
        the pieces in columns 0,1,2,3..etc.  The state is defined as the row
        of each queen. Namely, it is a set of eight integers, one per queen. Each
        integer value is constrained in the range [0,7]. This can be represented
        as a 8-component vector:

        \[s = \{{
x_1,x_2,....x_{n-1}, x_n}\}\]
    In the example shown in Figure 1. the state would be:

    \[s = \{7,5,3,1,6,4,2,0\}\]


    <h2> Transitions </h2>
    For a given state \(s_t\), the queen 0 has 8 choices. It can stay put, or it can move effectively
    to seven different squares. For the second queen, the options are the same regardless of the location
    of any other queen. Hence we have a total of:

      \[N =  8^8 -8 = 16 777 208 \]

    states that are reachable from any other state. We substract 8 in the formula above to acocut for the fact that if
    ALL the queens stay put, there is not a transition of states.

    This is a large number of states, if we scan them by randomly moving queens until a solution is found, 
    it may take a long time. There may be a better strategy.

    <h2> Hill-climbing algorithm </h2>

    The Hill-climbing algorith aims at scaning the state-space in a way slightly better than just at random. 
    Basically, a state is chosen at ramdon form all available. If the the state is closer to a solution than before, 
    the transiotion is accepted and rejected otherwise. The algorithm may get stuck in configurations for which 
    after several trials is not found a acceptable transition. 

    <h2> Cost function </h2>
    An acceptable transition is one that takes the configuration from a state to another stage with the condition 
    that the final state is closer to a solution. The closeness is evaluated via a cost function.

    Following the advise of <cite>Russel & Norvig</cite>, the cost function will be taken as the 
    total count of pairs of queens attacking each other. In figure 1, the cost of the state would be 1. 
    The aim is to find a state with an associated cost of zero. 


    <h3> Queens in the same row </h3> 

    If two queens are in a row, there is one pair of them atacking each other. If three queens are in 
    a row, thenthere are 2 pairs. In general, the number is the number of ways we can pick 2 out of N 
    queens in the same row. Namely: 
    

     \[Cost( N, i ) =  \frac{N_i!}{(N_i-2)!2!} \]

    is the const of having N_i queens in the same row i. We need to add the cost of all rows: 
    
     \[C_{rows}  = \sum_i \frac{N_i!}{(N_i-2)!2!} \]


    This is easily computed. The python code could be as:
    
    <pre><code class="html">
    from collections import Counter 
    import math 
    import random 
    import time 
    random.seed( 132454 )

    NCOLS = 8 
    NROWS = 8

    def cost(state):
        #number of pairs of queens under attact due to same-row occupancy 
        c= Counter(state) #count of the queens in each row
        for n in range( len(state) ): 
            sum_rows = sum([ math.factorial(c[n])/( math.factorial(c[n]-2)*2 ) if c[n]>=2 else 0 for n in range(len(state)) ])
       

        return sum_rows

    </code></pre>

    
    <h3> Queens in the same diagonal </h3> 

    This is trickier and it is key to be able to compute this cost quickly, since it 
    may be the case that we need to compute it many times. 

    Note, however,that we can enumerate the rows as in the figure 2, below.     
    The  top-left pointing diagonal, denoted as \(D1_k(i)\), that each queen i belongs to, is exactly the sum of 
    its row index and column index: 

     \[D_k(i) index = row_i + col_i \]
 


            <figure>
            <img src="DiagonalCost1.PNG" style="width: 600px" />
            <figcaption>
                Figure 2. Two queens belong to the same top-left-pointing diagonal if the sum of their 
                row index and column index is the same. The highlighted queen inside the red circle 
                is in column = 3 and row = 1, i.e. diagonal = 4. The one inside the green circle is 
                in diagonal = 10, because its column index = 6 and its ow index = 4.  
            </figcaption>
        </figure>


    Why is this convenient? well,because the same code used before can be reused now. Basically, 
    we just need to construct a vector for the state but instead of filling it with the row index,
    we fill it with the diagonal index. 

    The other diaginal direction is just the same, just that we need to start counting the columns from the right 
    hand side of the board. This is: 

         \[D2_k(i) =  row_i + |col_i - NCOLS - 1| \]
